        <h2>The Philippine Basketball Association (PBA)</h2>
        <p>The Philippine Basketball Association (PBA) is a men's professional basketball league in the Philippines
            composed
            of twelve company-branded franchised teams. It is the first professional basketball league in Asia and is
            the
            second oldest continuously existing league in the world after the NBA. The league's regulations are a hybrid
            of
            rules from the NBA and FIBA.</p>

        <p>The league played its first game at the Araneta Coliseum in Quezon City on April 9, 1975. Their main offices
            are
            located along Eulogio Rodriguez Jr. Avenue (C-5 road), Eastwood City, Libis, Quezon City.</p>

        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>The Philippine Basketball Association was founded when nine teams left the now-defunct Manila Industrial and
            Commercial Athletic Association (MICAA), which was tightly controlled by the Basketball Association of the
            Philippines (BAP), the FIBA-recognized national association at the time. With the BAP controlling the MICAA,
            the
            league was de jure amateur, as players were only paid allowances. This is much like what was done in other
            countries to circumvent the amateur requirement and to play in FIBA-sanctioned tournaments such as the
            Olympics.
            MICAA team owners were not pleased on how BAP, then led by Gonzalo "Lito" Puyat, were taking away their
            players
            to join the national team without consulting them first. The teams that bolted away from the MICAA are the
            Carrier Weathermakers, Crispa Redmanizers, Mariwasa-Noritake Porcelainmakers, Presto Ice Cream, Royal
            Tru-Orange, Seven-Up Uncolas, Tanduay Distillery, Toyota Comets, and the U/Tex Weavers. Leopoldo Prieto, the
            coach for the Philippines at the 1956 Melbourne Olympics, was appointed as the first commissioner, and
            Emerson
            Coseteng of Mariwasa-Noritake was chosen as the first president of the league's Board of Governors. The
            first
            game of the league was held at the Araneta Coliseum on April 9, 1975, featuring Mariwasa-Noritake and
            Concepcion
            Carrier.</p>

        <p>During the mid to late 80s, Jaworski and Ginebra San Miguel became the league's most popular squad for their
            "never say die" attitude. The team had intense rivalries with the Tanduay Rhum Masters and Jaworski's
            then-rival
            Fernandez, and later the expansion Purefoods Corporation and players Alvin Patrimonio, Jerry Codiñera, Jojo
            Lastimosa, and Fernandez.</p>

        <p>The early 1990s saw Ginebra and Shell forming an intense rivalry that included Ginebra's walkout in the 1990
            finals against Shell and the team's dramatic comeback from a 3-1 deficit to beat Shell in the 1991 First
            Conference. Patrimonio, Allan Caidic, and a host of others became the league's main attraction.</p>

        <p>In 2004, the league introduced drastic scheduling changes, when it decided to begin the season in October
            instead
            of January. The change in starting the season allowed the league to accommodate international tournaments
            held
            from June to September and it fit better with college hoops, the NCAA and the UAAP, whose seasons run from
            June
            to October. The league also reduced the number of conferences from three to two, renaming the All-Filipino
            Cup
            as the Philippine Cup and introducing a new import-laden tournament named as the Fiesta Conference. To
            accommodate these changes, a transitional tournament, the 2004 PBA Fiesta Conference, was held from February
            to
            July, which was won by the Barangay Ginebra Kings. The league also began to hold the annual All-Star weekend
            in
            the provinces, alternating between Luzon and Visayas/Mindanao provinces every year.</p>

        <p>On May 19, 2013, the third game of the PBA Commissioner's Cup Finals between the Alaska Aces and the Barangay
            Ginebra San Miguel set the all-time basketball attendance record of 23,436 at the Smart Araneta Coliseum,
            breaking the previous record of 23,108 set 11 days earlier during the semifinals series doubleheader between
            Alaska vs. San Mig Coffee and Barangay Ginebra vs. Talk 'N Text. This record was eventually broken on
            February
            12, 2014, when the seventh game of the 2013-14 PBA Philippine Cup Semifinals series between Barangay Ginebra
            San
            Miguel and San Mig Super Coffee Mixers set the all-time basketball attendance record of 24,883.</p>

        <h3>Season Format</h3>
        <p>Unlike other leagues, there is no "season champion" of the PBA. Instead, the season is divided into
            conferences
            or tournaments (not to be confused with the definition of a "conference" in a sporting context as a grouping
            of
            teams based on geography or historical affiliation), wherein the teams compete for a conference cup. The
            winners
            of the conference cups do not face each other at the end of the season to determine the season champion;
            instead, all conference champions are considered league champions, with the Philippine Cup being the most
            prestigious conference of the season.</p>

        <p>A season is usually composed of three conferences. Since the 2010–11 season, the conferences were named the
            Philippine, Commissioner's, and Governors' Cups, usually ending in a best-of-seven series where the winner
            takes
            the conference cup. If the same team wins all of the conferences, then the team is said to be the "Grand
            Slam"
            champion. A draft is held after the end of the Governors' Cup. An opening ceremony is held before the start
            of
            the first game of the season.</p>
