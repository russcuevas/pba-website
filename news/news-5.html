        </h1>

    <div class="section-box" style="margin-top: -50px;">
        <p>AKIL Mitchell carried Meralco Bolts to a come-from-behind 81-80 win over Busan KCC Egis to get back on track
            in the East
            Asian Super League (EASL) Home And Away Season 2 Wednesday night at the Philsports Arena.</p>

        <p>The 32-year-old Mitchell scored 11 of his game-high 33 points in the fourth quarter including the free throw
            in the
            final 6.4 seconds that clinched the dramatic victory for the reigning PBA Philippine Cup champion.</p>
        <p>Mitchell added 22 rebounds, the last of which came after Busan's Heo Ung missed on a jumper, eventually
            leading to Leon
            Williams committing his fifth and final foul that sent the Meralco import on the line.
        </p>
        <p>Jung Changyoung's desperation attempt from the back court fell short at the buzzer, allowing the Bolts to
            escape with
            their second win in three outings - the most by the team in the tournament.</p>

        <p>"He's been around and he knows how to win," said Meralco coach Luigi Trillo of Mitchell, who will be the
            Bolts' import
            in the coming Commissioner's Cup.</p>

        <p>DJ Kennedy added 14 points, while Chris Newsome and Bong Quinto had eight each for Meralco, which trailed by
            as many as
            63-72 with eight minutes left in the game on a tip in by Williams.</p>

        <p>Quinto's clutch three pointer with 31 seconds left tied the game at 80-all. He was 2-of-2 from the same
            distance.</p>

        <p>It was a heartbreaker of a loss for Busan, reigning Korean Basketball League (KBL) champion, which fell to a
            0-2 record
            in Group B.
        </p>

        <p>Former NBA player Deonte Burton led Busan with 26 points - including 22 in the first half - nine rebounds,
            and five
            assists, but fouled out in the final four minutes and his side leading, 75-71.</p>

        <p>Heo, the Finals MVP in the KBL last season, added 14 points on 4-of-8 shooting from long range, Lee Geunwhi
            also with
            14, while Williams had nine and 13 rebounds before likewise fouling out with six seconds to go. (RG)</p>

        <p>The scores</p>

        <p>Meralco (81) - Mitchell 33, Kennedy 14, Newsome 8, Quinto 8, Kouame 8, Hodge 6, Banchero 4, Caram 0.</p>
