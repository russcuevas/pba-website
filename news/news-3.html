    <div class="section-box" style="margin-top: -50px;">
        <p>A listless Gilas Pilipinas side kicked off its training camp Friday at the Inspire Sports Academy in Laguna,
            a week
            before the second window of the FIBA Asia Cup qualifiers.</p>

        <p>The mood wasn't lost on coach Tim Cone, who expected the atmosphere nonetheless since most of the players are
            coming
            from their respective stints in the East Asia Super League, the B. League in Japan, and the just concluded
            PBA
            Governors' Cup finals.</p>
        <p>"We were a little sluggish today, which is OK. We live with that," Cone said in a One Sports interview
            following the
            first day of the short camp.
        </p>
        <p>"We expect to pick it up as we go along."</p>

        <p>Despite the slow start, just about everybody was all accounted for as far as the 15-man Gilas pool is
            concerned,
            including injured wingman Jamie Malonzo.</p>

        <p>Young big man Carl Tamayo is set to arrive at the camp on Saturday following his stint in the Korean
            Basketball League
            (KBL) with the Changwon LG Sakers.</p>

        <p>It's the first time the national team convened together again since the FIBA Olympic Qualifying Tournament
            last August.</p>

        <p>"The first practice is always the hardest one. We try to bring everybody back together again," said Cone. "We
            try to get
            to rehash the offense, and there's always a little bit of some confusion, kind of remember it, jog your
            memory a little
            bit."
        </p>

        <p>The closed-door camp ends on Sunday.</p>

        <p>"The guys have experience already, so we expect them to pick it up as the camp go along," added Cone.</p>

        <p>Gilas will take on New Zealand on Nov. 21 at the Mall of Asia Arena in a battle between the top two teams in
            Group B.
            Both the Filipinos and Tall Blacks are undefeated in two games so far to share the top spot.</p>

        <p>Three days after, the host welcomes winless Hong Kong to cap the four-day meet at the Mall of Asia Arena.
