        </h1>

    <div class="section-box" style="margin-top: -50px;">
        <p>AKIL Mitchell feels right at home with Meralco right in his first game with the team.</p>

        <p>The 32-year-old import said the warm welcome he got from the Bolts made him at ease with the franchise right
            away, and
            it showed in the way he led the team in its 81-80 comeback win over Korean side Busan KCC Egis in the East
            Asia Super
            League (EASL) Home and Away Season 2 Wednesday night at the Philsports Arena.</p>
        <p>Mitchell had a game-high 33 points and 22 rebounds in his debut game with the franchise in a performance that
            certainly
            augurs well in the Bolts' coming campaign in the PBA Commissioner's Cup.
        </p>
        <p>"A lot of love, a lot of appreciation for this team for bringing me here. It's nothing but respect and they
            welcomed me
            like a family. It means a lot to me," said the American-Panamanian. "I've been to a lot of countries, to get
            here for
            just a few a days, I felt like I'm already part of the group. This is really special."</p>

        <p>Coach Luigi Trillo was thrilled at what he initially saw in the game of Mitchell and expects the import to
            get even
            better once he finally settles down with Meralco.</p>

        <p>"You look at the other teams, they probably have a little more talent. I think we've had our talent. But I
            think yung
            PBA Commissioner's Cup, we just have to be tough," said the champion coach.</p>

        <p>"And I think that's what Akil brings. We know the other teams have added players and we respect that. Some of
            the teams
            have also gotten quality imports. But we believe in our guys, we believe in the practices that we have, and
            he's going
            to fit in right to what we do."</p>

        <p>Mitchell, who previously suited up for the Panama national men's basketball team, led the Bolts' furious
            fight back in
            the fourth quarter after trailing by as many as 11 points against Busan.
        </p>

        <p>He had 11 during that crucial stretch and sank the free throw that won the game for the Bolts against the
            reigning
            Korean Basketball League (KBL) champions.</p>

        <p>Meralco improved to a 2-1 record in Group B following the heroics of Mitchell, who Trillo describes as a
            'bigger version
            of Cliff (Hodge) and Mike Philips' of La Salle.</p>

        <p>And this is just the beginning, according to the Meralco coach.</p>

        <p>"We've had a lot of work ahead of us, but so far we'd like what we see in practices and we have to continue
            that," said
            Trillo.(RG)</p>
