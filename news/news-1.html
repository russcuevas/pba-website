        <h1 style="font-size: 25px;">Commissioner's Cup parades old and new imports (Nov 17, 2024)</h1>
    </div>

        <img style="margin-top: -150px; padding: 20px;" src="../images/news/IMG_1195.jpeg" alt="">

    <div class="section-box" style="margin-top: -50px;">
        <p>FAMILIAR names and new faces make up the season's batch of imports in the coming PBA Commissioner's Cup.</p>
        <p>TNT's Rondae Hollis Jefferson and the indefatigable Justine Brownlee of Barangay Ginebra will bring their
            acts back once
            Asia's oldest play-for-pay league unveils its mid-season conference starting Nov. 27.</p>
        <p>The two Best Imports are fresh from a grueling Governors' Cup finals series which the Tropang Giga won over
            the Kings in
            six games.</p>
        <p>Also returning for another tour of duty in the league is high-scoring George King for Blackwater, Ricardo
            Ratliffe for
            Magnolia, and Quincy Miller, should San Miguel decide to tap his services aside from playing for the team in
            the ongoing
            East Asia Super League Home and Away Season 2.</p>

        <p>But there are also a number of newcomers who are out to prove themselves in the tournament that features
            unlimited
            height among imports.</p>

        <p>Akil Mitchell already showed what he can exactly do for Meralco when he rallied the Bolts past reigning
            Korean
            Basketball League (KBL) champion Busan KCC Egis during their EASL showdown, 81-80.</p>

        <p>The 6-foot-9 American-Panamanian hit a game-high 33 points and 22 rebounds in the comeback win.</p>

        <p>Northport meanwhile, will be bringing in 6-foot-11 Kavell Bigby-Williams, a former member of the Great
            Britain men's
            national team and cousin of former heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis, while Phoenix decided to go with
            6-foot-9 Donovan
            Smith.</p>

        <p>Converge has former NBA player Cheick Diallo to reinforce the franchise. A second round pick by the LA
            Clippers in the
            2016 NBA Draft, the 6-foot-8 Diallo was once teammate of former Phoenix top gun Matthew Wright with the
            Kyoto Hannaryz
            in the Japan B. League.</p>

        <p>Another former member of the Great Britain men's national team in Ryan Richards has been signed by
            Terrafirma, while
            Rain or Shine tapped former Cameroonian national team member Kenneth Kadji.</p>

        <p>NLEX earlier announced NBA veteran Ed Davis will be its import, but a last-minute family emergency had the
            35-year-old
            Davis backing out. (RG)</p>
