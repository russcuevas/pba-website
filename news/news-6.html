        <h1 style="font-size: 25px;">Brownlee motivated to bounce back in FIBA Asia Cup Qualifiers (Nov 13, 2024)
        </h1>
    </div>

    <div class="section-news">
        <img style="margin-top: -150px; padding: 20px;" src="../images/news/IMG_1188.jpeg" alt="">
    </div>

    <div class="section-box" style="margin-top: -50px;">
        <p>GILAS Pilipinas coach Tim Cone and naturalized player Justin Brownlee are using Barangay Ginebra's stinging
            loss in the
            PBA Governors' Cup finals as motivation for the coming FIBA Asia Cup Qualifiers.</p>

        <p>Cone and Brownlee will serve national team duties versus New Zealand on Nov. 21 and Hong Kong on Nov. 24 with
            the Gin
            Kings' 2-4 defeat to back-to-back champ TNT last Friday still fresh.</p>
        <p>"He (Brownlee) is not exactly happy about the way he played. I'm not happy about the way we played. I'm not
            happy about
            the way I coached. So, you know, I'm motivated to bounce back. But even more so, Justin's motivated to
            bounce back. So
            I'm looking forward to that," Cone said in Wednesday's press conference with Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas
            president
            Al Panlilio and executive director Erika Dy and Gilas team manager Richard del Rosario.
        </p>
        <p>"And when I have a motivated Justin, watch out," Cone added.</p>

        <p>He expressed belief the eight-day breather between Game 6 and the start of Gilas' training camp at Inspire in
            Laguna
            should be enough to get Brownlee back on his feet.</p>

        <p>"We've seen him highly motivated in the past and what he could do so I don't think anybody has anything to
            fear about
            Justin Brownlee. He'll be ready, he'll be raring to go and I think he's going to put up some really nice
            performances
            for the country coming up," he said.</p>

        <p>"The bottom line is, I think Justin's just going to be ready to play. And that doesn't mean he puts up big
            numbers. That
            means he's going to be locked into what we do, get his teammates involved and play the game the right way.
            And what he
            does 99 percent of the time."</p>

        <p>Joining Brownlee in the 15-man pool for the second window assignments are Scottie Thompson, June Mar Fajardo,
            CJ Perez,
            Calvin Oftana, Chris Newsome, Dwight Ramos, Kai Sotto, Carl Tamayo, AJ Edu, Kevin Quiambao, Mason Amos,
            Jamie Malonzo,
            Japeth Aguilar and backup naturalized player Ange Kouame.
        </p>

        <p>Malonzo, who is sidelined by calf injury, has been ruled out for the two home games already. Edu hurt his
            knee from a
            recent game in the Japan B. League and is listed as doubtful for the games.</p>
        <p>Cone said Aguilar and Amos will likely take the spot of the two in the final roster.
            Meanwhile, Sotto is still under concussion protocol and according to Del Rosario, his participation depends
            on whether
            he gets medical clearance in time for the two home gigs. (OL)</p>
