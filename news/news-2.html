        <h1 style="font-size: 25px;">Clark or McLaughlin for Hong Kong Eastern import (Nov 16, 2024)</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="section-news">
        <img style="margin-top: -150px; padding: 20px;" src="../images/news/IMG_1194.jpeg" alt="">
    </div>

    <div class="section-box" style="margin-top: -50px;">
        <p>IT'S either Cameron Clark or Chris McLaughlin as import for Hong Kong Eastern when it plays as guest team in
            the coming
            PBA Commissioner's Cup.</p>
        <p>Both the 6-foot-6 Clark and 6-foot-10 McLaughlin are seeing action for the 92-year-old Hong Kong-based
            franchise in the
            ongoing East Asia Super League (EASL) Home and Away Season 2.</p>
        <p>But with the mid-season conference allowing just one import to utilize, Hong Kong Eastern will have to choose
            who
            between Clark and McLaughlin is going to reinforce the team in its campaign in the meet that features
            imports of
            unlimited height.
        </p>
        <p>Based on its showing in the EASL so far where Eastern carries a 0-2 record, Clark leads the team in scoring
            with an
            average of 24.0 points, but McLaughlin is Hong Kong's top rebounder with a 12.0-rebound average.</p>

        <p>Clark of course, already had an experience playing in the PBA, having seen action with NLEX and San Miguel in
            two
            previous editions of the Governors' Cup, where he both steered the Road Warriors and Beermen to the
            semifinals.</p>

        <p>Some of his contemporaries such as Justine Brownlee and Rondae Hollis Jefferson are actually being
            highly-considered by
            Barangay Ginebra and TNT to reinforce them again after the two teams tangled in the recent Governors' Cup
            finals.</p>

        <p>On the other hand, McLaughlin's imposing presence in the middle could also be to Hong Kong's advantage
            especially with
            other towering imports such as Ricardo Ratliffe (Magnolia), Cheick Diallo (Converge), Akil Mitchell
            (Meralco), Ryan
            Richards (Terrafirma), among others, also tapped to play for the second conference.</p>

        <p>Commissioner Willie Marcial earlier said the same rules on import will be applied by the league on Hong Kong.
        </p>

        <p>Under PBA rules, the original import choice can be replaced for any reason, but should be relegated by the
            team on the
            injured/reserved list in order for him to be eligible for reactivation.</p>

        <p>Failure to consign him in the injured/reserved list meant the team won't be able to bring him back again.</p>

        <p>On the other hand, the replacement import once substituted, will no longer be able to return for the rest of
            the team's
            campaign.</p>

        <p>So, will it be Clark or McLaughlin for Hong Kong Eastern? (RG)</p>
